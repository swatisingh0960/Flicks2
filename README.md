# Flicks2
Movie Flicks app shows the movies currently playing in theaters. The app utilizes the Movie Database API to display images and basic information about these movies to the user.

- To build an app to help users discover Popular Movies, Top Rated Movies, Upcoming Movies and Now Playing movies. 
- Built a clean UI, sync to a server, and present information to the user.
- Allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser) and share it with your contacts. 
- Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
- Allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star).
- Created a database to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed to display their favorites collection while offline).
- Modified the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.


Please add The_Movie_DB_API key in the 'strings.xml' file.
